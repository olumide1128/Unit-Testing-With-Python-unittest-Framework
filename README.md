# Unit-Testing-With-Python-unittest-Framework
This project performs Unit testing on the methods of an Employee Class using the Unittest framework in Python.

# Instructions
- To run, after cloning this repo, open a cmd and type 'python test_employee.py' to run the test script.
- I added the 'unittest.main()' in the test_employee.py script so we don't need to enter 'python -m unittest test_employee.py'
- You should see 'Ran 3 tests' without any fail because non of the test failed.
- Modify the values in the test methods/cases to make the test fail.

# Cheers!
